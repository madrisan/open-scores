      Thus: away with “motivic working out.”

      Away with harmony as cement or bricks of a building.

      Then: Away with Pathos!

      massive claptrap.

      My music must be \italic brief.

      Concise! In two notes: not built, but “expressed”!!
    }
    \wordwrap \abs-fontsize #11 {
      And the result I wish for: no stylized and sterile protracted emotion.
      People are not like that: it is \italic impossible to a person to have \italic one sensation
      at a time.
      One has \italic thousands simultaneously. And these thousands can no more readily be added
      together than and apple and a pear. They do their own way.

      And this variegation, this multifariousness, this \italic illogicality which our senses demonstrate,
      the illogicality presented by their interactions, set forth by some mounting rush of blood,
      by some reaction of the senses, or the nerves, this I should like to in my music.

      It should be an expression of feeling, as our feelings, which bring us in contact with our
      subconscious, really are, and no false child of feelings and “conscious logic”.

      You will not number amongst those who burn me: that I know.
